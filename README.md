## Description

This is a native mobile app built using React Native. The app provide users with a chat interface, as well as options to share messages, images and their location.

<br>

## Purpose of this App

Chat App was developed to provide an opportunity to learn about native app development, and practice the relevant skills.

<br>

## Key Features:
* A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
* A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
* The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.
* Data gets stored online and offline.

<br>

## User Stories:

* As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my
friends and family.
* As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange
the latest news.
* As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
* As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
* As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any
time.
* As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen
reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

## Setup

1. Clone the Github repo to your local machine by selecting "Download ZIP" from the "Code" dropdown menu.

2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.

3. Use command "npm install" to install all local dependencies.
 - npm must be installed globally on your machine to run this command.
 - The app is now ready to run on your machine.

 4. Use command "expo start" to start the test environment.

 5. Test the app using your method/device of choice.
 - To test in Android Emulator, first install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), then then press `a` while expo is running.
    
    - (Macs only) To test in iOS Simulator, first ensure [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) is installed, and then press `i` while expo is running.
   
    - To test on any Android or iOS device, first install the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app, and then scan the QR code generated in your terminal when Expo is running (using the Expo Go app on Android or Camera on iOS). Both the local machine and the mobile device must be connected to the same network or plugged into each other in order to emulate the app on the mobile device.
